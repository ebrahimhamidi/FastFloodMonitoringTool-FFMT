# FastFloodMonitoringTool-FFMT
This App provides intuitive web-based visualization tools to facilitate easy assessment of flood extents.
App created by Ebrahim Hamidi (University of Alabama) and reviewed by Brad G. Peter (University of Arkansas), funded by the National Science Foundation INFEWS Program and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Also, partial support for development of this App is awarded through CUAHSIâ€™s 2023 Hydroinformatics Innovation Fellowship (HIF).

We hope this app provides tools to facilitate flood monitoring tasks. For example, users can define a flood period, select a location, and draw a boundary to observe the flood extent conditions in their area of interest.
Through this App, our aim is to empower decision-makers, first responders, and other stakeholders with clear, useful information, enabling them to better understand, prepare for, and respond to treacherous flooding hazards. This information is crucial, considering the populations, infrastructure facilities, urban area, and cropland at risk.
