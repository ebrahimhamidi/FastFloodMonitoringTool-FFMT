  abstract="Working on countermeasures to reduce floods and respond quickly is vital for ensuring fatalities are reduced to a minimum. Remote sensing can provide an adequate amount of information for flood management systems. Techniques from several disciplines, considering image processing, remote sensing, machine learning, and data analysis, have been investigated in the literature to manage various flood management duties. Despite the growing number of research articles outlining the application of numerous computer vision techniques in the field of remote sensing applications, there exists a dire need for a complete analysis of these technologies from the standpoint of flood management. This chapter aims to fulfill this need by providing a comprehensive review of the literature covering all aspects of remote sensing applications for flood management including flood detection, flood delineation of affected areas, and damage assessment. The review is organized to cover both traditional and deep learning methods as well as the open-source datasets used in the relevant studies. In addition, the chapter investigates existing products and services that currently provide usable insights about past or ongoing flood disasters to emergency response operations. Finally, the chapter highlights the challenges and future areas of research in flood management.",
